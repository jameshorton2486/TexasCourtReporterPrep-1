Key Requirements:

Question Generation:
File-Based: Utilize uploaded exam files as a primary source for generating questions.
Web-Based: If no files are uploaded, search the internet for relevant exam materials and generate questions from those results.
Question Rewording:
Implement a technique to reword questions without altering their meaning, ensuring a diverse question pool.
Avoid repetitive questions by maintaining a record of generated questions and filtering out duplicates.
Perplexity API Integration:
Securely integrate the Perplexity API into the application to access its advanced language processing capabilities.
Set a low temperature parameter to ensure the generated questions and answers are accurate and relevant.
User Interface:
Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to:
Upload exam files.
Initiate the question generation process.
View and practice with the generated questions.
Code Structure Suggestions:

Python
import perplexity
import requests
import os

# Securely store Perplexity API key
perplexity_api_key = os.environ.get('PERPLEXITY_API_KEY')

def generate_questions(files=None):
    if files:
        # Process uploaded files to extract relevant information
        # ...

    else:
        # Search the internet for relevant exam materials
        # ...

    # Use Perplexity API to generate questions and answers
    response = perplexity.generate_text(
        prompt="Generate multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, ensuring accuracy and avoiding repetition.",
        text=extracted_text,
        temperature=0.2  # Low temperature for accurate and focused output
    )

    # Process the generated questions and answers
    # ...

    # Reword questions to avoid repetition
    # ...

    return questions, answers

# ... (Rest of the application code, including user interface, question display, etc.)
Use code with caution.

Additional Considerations:

Question Difficulty: Consider implementing a mechanism to adjust question difficulty based on user preferences or performance.
Explanation Generation: Explore using Perplexity to generate explanations for correct and incorrect answers.
User Feedback: Allow users to rate the quality of questions and provide feedback to improve the generation process.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and API rate limits.
