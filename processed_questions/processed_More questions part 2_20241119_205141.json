    "correct_answer": "A: A motion to dismiss asks the court to throw out a case due to legal insufficiency, typically before considering the merits. A motion for summary judgment asks t he court to rule in favor of one party without a full trial, based on undisputed material facts. 2. Q: What is \"voir dire\" and why is it conducted in court proceedings? A: Voir dire is the process of questioning potential jurors to assess their suitability for jury duty. It's conducted to identify biases, conflicts of interest, or other factors that might affect a juror's impartiality, allowing attorneys to make informed decisions during jury selection. 3. Q: Define \"nunc pro tunc\" and describe its typical use in legal contexts. A: Nunc pro tunc, meaning \"now for then\" in Latin, refers to a court ruling that has retroactive effect.

These briefs often provide broader perspectives or specialized knowledge. 8. Q: Describe the legal doctrine of \"respondeat superior\" and its implications.

A: Probation is a sentence that allows an offender to remain in the community under supervision instead of going to prison. Parole is the early release of a prisoner who agrees to abide by certain conditions, typically after serving part of their sentence. Probation is imposed at sentencing, while parole comes after incarceration. 10. Q: What is \"habeas corpus\" and why is it significant in the legal system? A: Habeas corpus, meaning \"produce the body\" in Latin, is a legal action or writ by which a person can seek relief from unlawful detention. It's significant as a fundamental protecti on against arbitrary imprisonment, allowing detainees to challenge the legal basis for their detention in court. Professional Standards & Ethics 1. Q: What steps should a court reporter take upon discovering a significant error in a certified transcript? A: The court reporter should immediately notify all parties involved and the court.

Q: What ethical guidelines should court reporters follow regarding social media use? A: Court reporters should avoid discussing or posting about ongoing cases, even vaguely.

Any professional use of social media should maintain the same level of confidentiality and professionalism as their work. 4. Q: Why is impartiality crucial in court reporting, and how can it be maintained? A: Impartiality is crucial because court reporters create the official record of proceedings.

Q: How should court reporters handle confidential information from off -the-record conversations? A: Court reporters must treat all information obtained during legal proceedings, including off-the-record conversations, as strictly confidential.

Q: What are the ethical guidelines for court reporters regarding gift acceptance? A: Court reporters should generally refrain from accepting gifts from attorneys, parties, or witnesses involved in cases they're reporting. Accepting gifts could create an ap pearance of impropriety or bias. If offered a gift, it should be politely declined to maintain professional integrity. 8. Q: How should a court reporter respond if asked for their opinion on a case they're reporting? A: Court reporters should refrain from offering opinions on cases they're reporting. They should politely explain that their role is to provide an impartial reco rd of the proceedings, not to comment on the case. Offering opinions could compromise their impartiality and the integrity of the transcript. 9. Q: What ethical considerations apply to the storage and disposal of stenographic notes and recordings? A: Court reporters must securely store all stenographic notes and recordings to maintain confidentiality. When disposing of these materials, they should follow applicable legal requirements and ensure complete destruction to prevent unauthorized access.

This helps maintain the high quali ty and integrity of their work, ensuring they can provide the best possible service to the legal system and all parties involved. Grammar & Vocabulary 1.

A: The Oxford comma (the comma before \"and\" in a list of three or more items) is important in legal writing because it can prevent ambiguity. For example, in a will stating \"I leave my estate to John, Jane and Mary,\" it's unclear whether Jane and Mary share a portion or get separate shares. \"I leave my estate to John, Jane, and Mary\" is clearer. 7. Q: How do \"counsel\" and \"council\" differ in legal contexts?

For example: \"The defendant sought counsel\" vs. \"The city council passed the ordinance.\" 8. Q: How should Latin phrases be formatted in legal writing? A: Latin phrases should typically be italicized in legal writing, especially if they're not common in everyday English. For example: de novo, prima facie, res ipsa loquitur. However, very common La tin phrases (like \"et al.\" or \"etc.\") are often not italicized. 9. Q: What's the difference between \"principal\" and \"principle\" in legal contexts? A: \"Principal\" can be a noun meaning a main participant or a sum of money, or an adjective meaning main or most important. \"Principle\" is always a noun meaning a fundamental truth, law, or standard. For example: \"The principal amount of the loan\" vs. \"The principle of due process.\" 10. Q: How should hyphens be used with compound modifiers in legal writing? A: Compound modifiers (two or more words that act as a single adjective) should be hyphenated when they come before a noun. For example: \"well -established precedent,\" \"good-faith effor t.\" However, if the modifier comes after the noun, hyphens are typically not used: \"The precedent is well established.\" Transcription Standards 1.

Q: Why is impartiality crucial in court reporting, and how can it be maintained? A: Impartiality is crucial because court reporters create the official record of proceedings.

Q: How do \"counsel\" and \"council\" differ in legal contexts?

A: Latin phrases should typically be italicized in legal writing, especially if they're not common in everyday English. For example: de novo, prima facie, res ipsa loquitur.

A: \"Principal\" can be a noun meaning a main participant or a sum of money, or an adjective meaning main or most important. \"Principle\" is always a noun meaning a fundamental truth, law, or standard. For example: \"The principal amount of the loan\" vs. \"The principle of due process.\" 10. Q: How should hyphens be used with compound modifiers in legal writing? A: Compound modifiers (two or more words that act as a single adjective) should be hyphenated when they come before a noun.
