The error "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')" typically occurs in JavaScript when you try to add an event listener to an element that doesn't exist in the DOM.
Here's why this happens and how to fix it:
Common Causes:
Incorrect Element Selection: You're trying to select an element that doesn't exist in the HTML, or you're using an incorrect selector.
JavaScript Execution Timing: Your JavaScript code runs before the element is loaded in the DOM.
Solutions:
Check your selector:
Make sure the selector you're using in your JavaScript code (e.g., document.getElementById(), document.querySelector()) correctly targets the element you want to add the event listener to.
Wait for the DOM to load:
Ensure that your JavaScript code is executed after the DOM is fully loaded. You can achieve this by:
Placing your JavaScript code at the end of the HTML file, just before the closing </body> tag.
Using the DOMContentLoaded event:
JavaScript

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Your JavaScript code here
});
Check for null: Before adding an event listener, check if the element exists:
JavaScript

const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

if (button) {
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        // Your event handler code
    });
} else {
    console.error('Button element not found.');
}
Example:
JavaScript

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const myButton = document.getElementById('myButton');

    if (myButton) {
        myButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
            console.log('Button clicked!');
        });
    }
});
