How the Repair Tool Works

Fortect not only detects when Windows isn’t running properly, but it also fixes the problem at its core. Any damaged or missing files are replaced by original copies from Windows System File Checker, while your system is optimized and secured based on the latest knowledge. Malware, Registry, Browser Cache, and Junk files modules can be accessed within the app.

In less than five minutes, the scan will check your PC's health, flagging hardware issues like maxed-out memory or overheating, security threats from viruses or malware, and any unstable software prone to crashes. This hardware, security, and stability summary is compared against a healthy Windows installation, so you know exactly how damaged your system is.

Next, you'll review the results and choose to Activate the repair. Every system file, DLL, and registry key that is damaged, corrupt, or missing, is quarantined, ready to be repaired. Junk files are removed to free up space and resources. Problematic files are then repaired or completely replaced by healthy copies of original Windows system files, improving or even optimizing your PC's performance.
