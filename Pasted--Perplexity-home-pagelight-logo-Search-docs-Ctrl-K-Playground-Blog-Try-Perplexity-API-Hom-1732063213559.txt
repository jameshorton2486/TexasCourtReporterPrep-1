Authorizations
Authorization
string
header

Bearer authentication header of the form Bearer <token>, where <token> is your auth token.

Body
application/json

string
required
The name of the model that will complete your prompt. Refer to Supported Models to find all the models offered.

messages
object[]
required
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.


Show child attributes

max_tokens
integer
The maximum number of completion tokens returned by the API. The total number of tokens requested in max_tokens plus the number of prompt tokens sent in messages must not exceed the context window token limit of model requested. If left unspecified, then the model will generate tokens until either it reaches its stop token or the end of its context window.

temperature
number
default: 0.2
The amount of randomness in the response, valued between 0 inclusive and 2 exclusive. Higher values are more random, and lower values are more deterministic.

top_p
number
default: 0.9
The nucleus sampling threshold, valued between 0 and 1 inclusive. For each subsequent token, the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. We recommend either altering top_k or top_p, but not both.

return_citations
boolean
default: false
Determines whether or not a request to an online model should return citations.

search_domain_filter
any[]
Given a list of domains, limit the citations used by the online model to URLs from the specified domains. Currently limited to only 3 domains for whitelisting and blacklisting. For blacklisting add a - to the beginning of the domain string.

return_images
boolean
default: false
Determines whether or not a request to an online model should return images. Images are in closed beta access

return_related_questions
boolean
default: false
Determines whether or not a request to an online model should return related questions. Related questions are in closed beta access

search_recency_filter
string
Returns search results within the specified time interval - does not apply to images. Values include month, week, day, hour.

top_k
number
default: 0
The number of tokens to keep for highest top-k filtering, specified as an integer between 0 and 2048 inclusive. If set to 0, top-k filtering is disabled. We recommend either altering top_k or top_p, but not both.

stream
boolean
default: false
Determines whether or not to incrementally stream the response with server-sent events with content-type: text/event-stream.

presence_penalty
number
default: 0
A value between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. Incompatible with frequency_penalty.

frequency_penalty
number
default: 1
A multiplicative penalty greater than 0. Values greater than 1.0 penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. A value of 1.0 means no penalty. Incompatible with presence_penalty.

Response
200 - application/json
id
string
An ID generated uniquely for each response.

model
string
The model used to generate the response.

object
string
The object type, which always equals chat.completion.

created
integer
The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the completion was created.

choices
object[]
The list of completion choices the model generated for the input prompt.

what api key are they talking about mySql
GPT-4o Mini
In the context of MySQL, the term "API key" is not typically used in the same way it is for web services or APIs. Instead, MySQL uses user authentication to allow access to databases. Here’s a brief overview:

User Credentials: To connect to a MySQL database, you'll usually need a username and password. These are the credentials that allow you to authenticate against the database.

Connection String: When connecting to a MySQL database from an application (like a web application or a script), you will typically include the username and password in the connection string.

API Services: If you're using a service that provides a MySQL database (like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, etc.), they may have their own forms of authentication, including API keys for management tasks or for accessing the service programmatically.

Environment Variables: It is common practice to store sensitive information such as database credentials in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your application code.


If you're looking for how to connect your application to a MySQL database, you would typically use the database’s hostname, username, password, and the database name in your connection setup. If you're using a specific library or framework to connect to MySQL, refer to its documentation for how to properly authenticate and connect.
If you have a specific service or tool in mind that mentions an "API key" in relation to MySQL, please provide more details for a more targeted explanation.

What are VGA cables used to connect on a mother board?
GPT-4o Mini
VGA (Video Graphics Array) cables are used to connect displays (like monitors or projectors) to a computer's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) or integrated graphics on the motherboard. Here are the key points regarding VGA connections:

Analog Signal: VGA transmits video signals in analog format, which means it can carry the video information using varying voltage levels. This is in contrast to digital connections (like HDMI or DisplayPort) that send digital signals.

Connector Type: A VGA connection typically uses a 15-pin D-sub connector. The VGA cable has a male connector on one end (which plugs into the monitor) and usually a female connector on the other end (to connect to the output port of the computer's GPU or motherboard).

Monitor Connection: The primary use of a VGA cable is to connect a monitor to a computer. Many older monitors and projectors still use VGA, though most modern displays have moved to digital connections.

Integrated Graphics: If your motherboard has integrated graphics (often found in CPUs with onboard graphics), you can use the VGA port directly on the motherboard to connect a monitor. This is especially useful for systems that don’t have a dedicated graphics card.

Resolution Limitations: VGA can support various resolutions, but it is generally limited compared to modern digital connections. Higher resolutions and refresh rates are better supported by connections like HDMI, DisplayPort, or DVI.


In modern setups, VGA is becoming less common as newer standards like HDMI and DisplayPort offer better performance, including higher resolutions and support for audio. Some newer monitors may not even include a VGA port, focusing instead on digital connections.

Apache pictorial baskets 21"x5"   
GPT-4o Mini
It seems you're referring to Apache pictorial baskets, which are traditional woven baskets created by the Apache people, Native Americans from the southwestern United States. These baskets are often characterized by their intricate designs and vibrant colors, typically made using natural materials such as willow, yucca, and other plant fibers.
Key Features of Apache Pictorial Baskets:


Size: The dimensions you mentioned, 21"x5", indicate a basket that is relatively large in diameter but shallow in depth. This size could be used for decorative purposes, serving food, or storage.

Pictorial Designs: Pictorial baskets often depict scenes from nature, animals, or symbolic representations significant to Apache culture. The designs may tell stories or represent cultural beliefs.

Craftsmanship: The creation of these baskets involves skilled weaving techniques passed down through generations. Each basket can take many hours or even days to complete, reflecting the artisan's dedication and skill.

Materials: As mentioned, these baskets are typically made from natural fibers. The colors can come from dyes made from plants, minerals, or other natural sources.

Cultural Significance: Apache baskets are not just functional items; they hold cultural significance and are often used in ceremonies or as gifts. They are considered valuable both as art pieces and as part of the Apache heritage.


If you're looking for specific information on purchasing Apache pictorial baskets of that size, you would typically find them at galleries specializing in Native American art, craft fairs, or online marketplaces that focus on handmade or indigenous products. Always ensure that you are sourcing these items ethically and supporting artisans directly when possible.
